leader of the powerful lebanese militia hezbollah, had just finished his highly anticipated speech, and ali jaber, 64, was staring numbly at the cafe’s flickering television screen, even as the street outside erupted into celebratory gunfire.\n\n“i was hoping for more,” mr. jaber, a taxi driver, said.\n\nwhile many in lebanon breathed a sigh of relief on friday that mr. nasrallah had not announced an opening of a second front with israel, some in hezbollah’s southern beirut power base, expressed frustration that not enough was being done to end what they saw as the wholesale massacre of palestinians in gaza.\n\n“we have an occupied land, and we want to free it,” said mr. jaber, whose glass eye serves as a daily reminder of the years he spent fighting israel’s invasion of lebanon in 1982.\n\nthe urge to act in support of palestinians in gaza has even inspired songs: “for allah’s sake, o’sayyed come on!” blares one of the most popular tunes, referencing mr. nasrallah.\n\nafter the gaza hospital blast, hundreds in beirut’s southern suburbs chanted the lyrics as they marched through the streets in anger. tiktok users in the country have increasingly filled the app with voice-overs of the song.\n\nhezbollah is supported by iran and allied with hamas. like hamas, it is committed to the destruction of israel, but it has a more powerful and sophisticated military wing, with tens of thousands of trained fighters, an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets and a stock of precision-guided missiles that can strike targets deep inside israel. the united states considers it a terrorist organization.\n\nmr. nasrallah appeared to assuage those growing calls for hezbollah to open a second front on friday, stressing that the group was already doing what it set out to do: to keep israeli forces tied up along the northern border with lebanon, reducing the burden on hamas.\n\nhe made clear, however, that hezbollah’s forces were ready for anything.\n\nwith lebanon still reeling from a historic economic collapse, most lebanese have little desire for a protracted conflict with israel that would very likely spell further disaster. one poll by al akhbar, a newspaper perceived as sympathetic to hezbollah, found that about two-thirds of people in lebanon did not support an escalation. even the country’s shia muslims, the bedrock of hezbollah’s supporter base, were split down the middle on the issue, according to the poll.\n\nbut in beirut’s southern suburbs, a sprawling and poor area of the capital that was largely leveled by israeli airstrikes during the 2006 lebanon war, the images of gaza’s destruction have reopened old wounds.\n\nthough mr. jaber, the taxi driver, is recovering from six heart surgeries, he vowed to “fight as much as i can” in any wider conflict with israel.\n\n— euan ward reporting in beirut, lebanon\nstrikes continue to pound gaza, where officials say hospitals and a school were hit.\nimage\nan injured girl, with blood on her body

casualties, she said that reports indicated that dozens were injured and some 20 people were killed, including children. the school had been sheltering 16,000 people as of oct. 12.\n\n“at least one strike hit the schoolyard where there were tents for displaced families,” the spokeswoman, juliette touma, said. “another strike hit inside the school where women were baking bread.”\n\nthe israeli military said it was looking into the reports.\n\nthe u.n. says an estimated 160,000 displaced people are sheltering in 57 unrwa facilities in northern gaza, but the agency has not been able to

of gaza city, killing two people and wounding many others, the health ministry said.\n\nthe al-nasr children’s hospital is about a mile north of al shifa hospital, the territory’s largest, where a strike on friday near its entrance killed more than a dozen people. health officials said the strike targeted an ambulance convoy trying to transport wounded people to the border with egypt for evacuation.\n\nisrael said it was targeting hamas militants using an ambulance in the convoy, and that “a number” of them were killed. but gaza’s health ministry called the strikes near hospitals a deliberate attempt to terrorize medical personnel and wounded people and it accused israel of lying to justify its actions.\n\nthe world health organization said saturday that it condemned attacks that were reported on friday near al shifa and the nearby al quds and indonesian hospitals, and once again called for an immediate cease-fire. the organization said the attacks on health care institutions and restricting the delivery of medical supplies, fuel and water may amount to violations of international humanitarian law.”\n\nabout half of gaza’s hospitals have already shut down

the new york times\nsearching for survivors and bodies in a building after it was hit by an israeli airstrike on thursday in khan younes, in the southern gaza strip.\n\nsix days of israeli airstrikes have left more than 300,000 palestinians in the gaza strip homeless, with two million residents facing critical shortages of food, water and fuel, while israeli troops prepared on thursday for a possible ground invasion after hamas’s deadly weekend assault.\n\nretaliating for the bloodiest attack on israel in 50 years, israel is pummeling gaza with a ferocity not seen in past conflicts and has cut off vital supplies to the coastal territory. health officials in gaza, home to two million people, said the israeli bombardment had killed more than 1,500 people and injured over 6,600 others.\n\nisrael’s military says that it is hitting places used by hamas, which controls gaza, including mosques, houses and other outwardly civilian locations. gazans say the airstrikes are doing indiscriminate damage to civilians and civilian sites, and independent observers have confirmed that schools and ambulances have been destroyed.\n\nthe retaliatory strikes began after hamas terrorists broke through the border fence with israel on saturday morning and attacked towns, kibbutzim and a military base, killing more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, wounding about 3,000 others and kidnapping about 150 hostages, the israeli government said.\n\ngaza’s only power plant stopped generating electricity on wednesday for lack of fuel, shutting down everything from lights to refrigerators, and much of the region lacks running water. hospitals are overwhelmed with wounded patients and running out of vital supplies; fuel for generators and vehicles is dwindling rapidly; food and water are growing scarce; and it is not clear when humanitarian aid might be allowed in.\n\n“we are facing a huge disaster,” adnan abu hasna, an official with the united nations agency that aids palestinian refugees, said by phone from gaza. he described conditions as “absolutely horrible.”\nimage\nisraeli soldiers patrolling on thursday at the area of the music festival that was overrun

benjamin netanyahu at a military base in tel aviv to reinforce support for israel “as long as america exists.”\n\n“i come before you not only as the u.s. secretary of state, but also as a jew,” said mr. blinken, whose stepfather, samuel pisar, survived nazi concentration camps. “i understand on a personal level the harrowing echoes that hamas’s massacres carry for israeli jews and for jews everywhere.”\n\nhe added, “this is, this must be, a moment for moral clarity.”\n\nbut mr. blinken also suggested the need for caution in israel’s retaliation. “it’s important to take every possible precaution to prevent harming civilians,” he said.\n\nmr. netanyahu has said that hamas shot children in the head, burned people alive, raped women and decapitated soldiers.\n\nin a videoconference call to nato headquarters, defense minister yoav gallant of israel showed a video of the hamas attacks that jens stoltenberg, nato’s secretary general, called “horrific.” defense secretary lloyd j. austin iii later added, “we are appalled by the emerging scope of the atrocities committed by the terrorists of hamas.”\n\nthe white house said 27 u.s. citizens were killed in the hamas attack, and the state department said there were 500 to 600 americans living or visiting in gaza whose safety it was trying to guarantee.\nimage\na stroller abandoned near an intersection in sderot, a city in

spokesman abu ubaida said the group had achieved more than it had hoped for in its attack, which he said involved a 3,000-person battalion and a 1,500-person backup force. he confirmed reports that hamas had successfully duped israeli intelligence into believing that it did not want a major conflict.\n\n“we are telling the enemy, if you dare enter gaza, we will destroy your army,” he said.\n\nisrael has called up 360,000 reservists and is building up a large force on the border with gaza — as well as a smaller one near the northern border with lebanon — amid widespread speculation that it will invade the hamas-held territory, which it last did in 2014.\n\nthe military “is preparing multiple operational contingency plans” for what it expects will be a protracted war, lt. col. richard hecht, a spokesman for the israel defense forces, told reporters. “we’re waiting to see what our political leadership decides about a potential ground war. this has not been decided yet.”\n\nhe said israeli warplanes were concentrating on striking targets belonging to an elite hamas unit known as the nukhba, which is believed to have led the attack on israel. “we plan to get every one of those people,” he said.\n\nthough israeli forces retook all of the area overrun by the incursion within a few days, hamas fighters were still trying to enter israel, including by sea, colonel hecht said, adding that two were captured and five were killed on wednesday.\n\nin gaza, 338,000 people have been displaced, the united nations said, with most of them taking shelter in u.n. schools. egypt, which with israel has enforced a blockade of gaza for 16 years, has refused to allow people fleeing the bombardment to enter its territory. u.s. officials said the biden administration was talking with israel and egypt about safe passage for civilians to leave and relief supplies to enter.\n\nisraeli warplanes have bombed 88 educational facilities in gaza, including 18 u.n. schools, two of which were being used to shelter civilians, said stéphane dujarric, a u.n. spokesman.\nimage\nmourners during the funeral of multiple members of the al-bushaiti family, who were killed in an

acceptable,” fabrizio carboni, the middle east director of the international committee of the red cross, said at a news briefing. he added, “we need a safe humanitarian space.”\n\na steady stream of broken and lifeless bodies was flowing into gaza’s largest medical center, al shifa hospital. ambulances, yellow cabs and private vehicles screeched to a halt at the entrance to deliver the wounded. adults arrived carrying injured children or pushing people on stretchers or wheelchairs.\n\ninside, bloodied patients sat or lay on the tile floor, waiting for treatment. outside, bodies wrapped in white cloth lined the sidewalk waiting to be identified or collected by loved ones.\n\nmany of the limestone villas and high-rise buildings surrounding the hospital in its affluent gaza city

relations between its two regional archenemies, saudi arabia and israel. u.s. officials say that, so far, they have seen no evidence of iranian involvement in the hamas attack.\n\nbut on thursday, the united states and qatar agreed to refreeze $6 billion in iranian oil revenue, preventing tehran from spending it. the biden administration agreed in august to release the money for iran to spend on humanitarian needs in exchange for the release of americans held prisoner in iran.\n\nthe hamas attack on saturday came as a shocking setback for israel, with its powerful military and renowned intelligence services. the security apparatus failed to anticipate the incursion, failed to see that its border defenses could be defeated easily and failed at first to grasp the breadth of the assault and coordinate a response. people pleading for help waited hours for police officers or troops to arrive.\n\nwhile israelis have largely shown solidarity in the aftermath, israeli politicians have begun to face a backlash. on wednesday, idit silman, a member of mr. netanyahu’s right-wing likud party who serves as environmental minister, faced a heckling crowd while she visited injured people at a hospital.\n\n“you are responsible! go home,” yelled one person, according to video published by ynet, a popular israeli news site.\n\ntransportation minister miri regev was chased to her car and cursed at thursday when she tried to visit the injured at a hospital, and security guards restrained a young man who hurled objects at her car. she has been widely criticized for not arranging emergency transportation for troops called to duty on saturday, the jewish sabbath, when most public transportation shuts down.\n\nnir barkat, the economy minister, also confronted a displeased crowd at a hospital, when he met with the wounded in tel aviv, according to video shared on social media.\n\nin an interview with channel 14 in israel, a man named shirel chogeg grew increasingly irate as

NYT,"s senate testimony on tuesday.\n\npresident biden’s secretaries of state and defense appealed to senators on tuesday not to split up a sweeping $105 billion package of aid assembled to address the wars in ukraine and gaza, as well as threats to the indo-pacific region and along the u.s.-mexico border.\n\n“for our adversaries, be they states or nonstates, this is all one fight,” said antony j. blinken, the secretary of state. “if we start to peel off pieces of this package, they will see that, they will understand that we are playing whack-a-mole, while they cooperate increasingly.”\n\nmr. blinken and the defense secretary, lloyd d. austin, appeared before a senate committee that is trying to craft an emergency spending package that reflects president biden’s requests. it was the first time either cabinet official had spoken publicly on capitol hill since hamas killed 1,400 israelis in attacks early this month, causing israel to retaliate with a siege, a weekslong bombardment and, most recently, a ground invasion of the gaza strip.\n\nisrael’s campaign has caused an international outcry, including from the united nations, which has warned about the toll of the war on civilians, who are running out of food, medicine and clean water. more than 8,000 palestinians have been killed in airstrikes since israel began retaliating, according to gaza’s hamas-run ministry of health.\n\nprotesters made up about one-third of the audience in the senate chamber, sitting with red-painted palms raised and interrupting the cabinet officials’ testimony with a series of demonstrations calling for a cease-fire.\n\nthe biden administration has stood with israel in resisting current calls for a cease-fire, arguing that it would give hamas too much time to regroup. “that would simply consolidate what hamas has been able to do,” mr. blinken said.\n\nstill, u.s. officials have urged israel to consider pauses in their military campaign to ensure more aid can get to palestinians. they have warned that rising anger against israel across the region could prompt iran-backed groups like hezbollah to open a second front in the conflict.\n\n“without swift and sustained humanitarian relief, the conflict is much more likely to spread,” mr. blinken said.\n\nmr. austin, similarly, argued there was a “moral, and operational, and strategic imperative” to take the needs of palestinian civilians into consideration. “if we fail to do that, it will create a bigger problem,” he said.\n\nmr. blinken said the need for aid shipments to gaza was “beyond urgent” and expressed the hope that the pace of shipments would soon reach 100 aid trucks per day, possibly this week. even that level was inadequate to meet the needs of the more than two million palestinians who live in gaza, he said. at least 500 trucks of goods were entering gaza each day before the war.\n\nmr. blinken also blamed hamas for blocking the departure of 400 americans and their families from the gaza strip.\n\nbut the political climate on capitol hill hung over much of the hearing, as democrats raised republican talking points against elements of the aid package and asked the cabinet officials to rebut them.\n\nsenator patty murray, democrat of washington and the panel’s chairwoman, encouraged mr. blinken to address republican concerns that aid for palestinian civilians would not end up flowing to hamas’s military wing.\n\nmr. blinken said that egyptian and israeli security officials were able to inspect the shipments and that there were no reports from the united nations or israel that the aid entering gaza was being diverted away from civilians. he added that the united states was working on ways to ship fuel to gaza exclusively for humanitarian purposes, like powering hospitals and water-desalination plants.\n\nmr. blinken and mr. austin made the case that israel’s fight against hamas, which has controlled gaza since 2007, should not be dissociated from the war in ukraine, given the increasingly close alliance between iran, which has long supported hamas, and russia.\n\nthat logic has been challenged by the house, where the new speaker, mike johnson, republican of louisiana, is having lawmakers vote on a stand-alone aid package for israel this week. he has not said when similar funding for ukraine might come to the floor.\n\nleading senate republicans have criticized the house’s approach, arguing that backpedaling on ukraine would only worsen israel’s security.\ngaya gupta\noct. 31, 2023, 5:24 p.m. etoct. 31,

painted yellow and green.\na military parade in sana, yemen, last month. credit...mohammed hamoud/getty images\nhouthi soldiers, wearing camouflage, on a trailer carrying a large rocket painted yellow and green.\n\nyemen’s houthi militia claimed an attempted attack on southern israel on tuesday, saying it had launched a “large batch” of ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones toward israeli targets.\n\nthe iran-backed militia carried out the attempted assault in response to what it called “brutal israeli-american aggression” in gaza, the houthi military spokesman, yahya sarea, said on the social media platform x. mr. sarea said the attack was the third operation conducted by the houthis “in support of our persecuted brothers in palestine,” and threatened further missile and drone assaults.\n\nthe times could not independently verify the houthi claims.\n\non tuesday, the israeli military said its aerial defense system had intercepted a surface-to-surface missile fired toward israel “from the area of the red sea.” it said it had also intercepted other “aerial threats” in the area, none of which entered israeli territory.\n\nthe israeli military did not say who was behind the attacks. but a senior official in the u.s. department of defense, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the israeli military had intercepted missiles launched from yemen that had a range of around 1,200 miles.\n\nyemeni analysts said the attack, despite being thwarted, demonstrated the expanding capabilities of the houthis, an iran-backed militia that took over the yemeni capital, sana, in 2014. after an unsuccessful attempt by a saudi-led military coalition to rout it, the group now rules much of northern yemen. it has also become an important arm of iran’s so-called “axis of resistance,” which includes the lebanese militia hezbollah and armed groups in iraq.\n\n“the houthis stepping into the battlefield, even in a symbolic manner, sends a clear message to israel — an unmistakable indication that a new force has emerged against it in the region,” said ahmed nagi, a senior yemen analyst at the international crisis group. diversifying the source of attacks on israel is a key strategy for the axis of resistance that is “designed to confound israel and deter the broadening of its ground military operations in gaza,” he said.\n\nsupport for the palestinian cause and hostility toward israel has long been a pillar of the houthi narrative. since the israeli military began its bombardment of gaza — responding to the oct. 7 attacks by hamas, the iran-backed armed group that controls gaza — houthi leaders have issued repeated threats to enter the fray. last week, abdulaziz bin habtour, prime minister of the houthi government, said the houthis might attack israeli ships in the red sea.\n\nin 2015, when the saudi-led military intervention in yemen began, the houthis didn’t even have the capability to carry out drone strikes, said farea al-muslimi, a research fellow at chatham house’s middle east and north africa program. but in the years that followed, they built up their capacity, with iranian support.\n\nlast year, attacks claimed by the houthis in the capital of the united arab emirates, abu dhabi — more than 700 miles from northern yemen — killed three people.\n\nisrael has begun to see the houthis as a threat in recent years, said daniel sobelman, a research fellow at harvard kennedy school’s middle east initiative who focuses on iran’s axis of resistance. in 2020, israel deployed iron dome batteries near the southern town of eilat after it assassinated a top iranian nuclear scientist, “fearing that the retaliation would come from yemen,” he said.\n\neven the potential of houthi attacks on southern israel means that “israel must now allocate capabilities that otherwise would have been used elsewhere,” mr. sobelman said.\n\nbut the extent to which the houthis present serious risks to israel is unclear, mr. nagi said.\n\ndespite the growth in their military capabilities, the houthis control a deeply impoverished territory torn apart by war. the israeli military, in contrast, maintains high-tech air defense systems and is backed by staunch u.s. government support.\n\nthat asymmetry also characterized the houthis’ conflict with saudi arabia. between 2015 and 2021, more than 1,000 missiles and drones launched by the houthis at saudi arabia were largely thwarted, killing around 120 people in total, according to saudi authorities. by comparison, airstrikes carried out by the saudi-led coalition in yemen, many of them by squadrons relying on u.s. support, killed more than 20,000 people, experts estimate.\nkaren zraick\nemma bubola\noct. 31, 2023, 4:13 p.m. etoct. 31, 2023\noct. 31, 2023, 4:13

say that israel’s decision to cut off water and its insistence that no fuel can enter the territory have created a man-made drought.\n\nthe small amount of aid that has entered the territory from egypt in recent days has included some water, as well as water purification supplies. but it is nowhere near sufficient to meet the needs of gaza’s 2.3 million residents, more than half of whom have been displaced from their homes, according to the united nations. and water facilities inside the territory cannot function without power sources.\n\nthe w.h.o. warned this week that an “imminent public health catastrophe looms” in gaza as people fleeing airstrikes crowd together in shelters. key infrastructure has been damaged amid the relentless campaign of airstrikes, which have coincided with a siege by israel that has cut off electricity, fuel, food and water. twelve of the enclave’s 35 hospitals were out of service because of fuel shortages or damage, according to the w.h.o.\n\nhussein owda, an aid worker with unrwa, the u.n. agency that aids palestinians, has found himself among the residents of an overcrowded shelter run by his employer in khan younis. the roughly 22,000 people living there were drinking water that was normally used for irrigation, he said on tuesday. only 24 toilets were available, he added.\n\nthe shelter had received a bit of aid from the trucks that came in through the rafah border crossing. his family got one package of food and water, he said, adding that the last time he ate, on monday, he shared a can of meat from the box with his children. he was trying to convince his 9-year-old daughter that they were on a camping trip. she didn’t believe him.\n\n“every basic need for humans became a distant dream for us,” he said.\n\njaber yahya, a 50-year-old teacher in deir al balah, had to leave his home because there was bombing nearby. he and his family are staying with a cousin in the same city. clean drinking water, whether in bottles or delivered by truck, was increasingly hard to find — prices were higher, and vendors do not have fuel to deliver it, he said. people were mixing together fresh and brackish water to stretch the supply out of desperation, he said.\n\nhis household was sharing its solar power with a neighbor in exchange for well water. the water was very salty — you have to squeeze your eyes shut so they don’t burn when you wash your face, he said.\n\n“but we are lucky to have it,” he said.\n\njuliette touma, a spokeswoman for unrwa, said that the agency was prioritizing delivering aid to its health centers and shelters, and that it was distributing wheat to bakeries. some of the aid being distributed is part of pre-existing stocks that are slowly being exhausted, their distribution hampered by safety concerns and a lack of fuel for cars and trucks, ms. touma said.\nvideo\nwar through the eyes of gaza’s children\n3:18\nat a u.n. camp in southern gaza, children have been forced to flee their homes and live in squalid conditions while trying to make sense of a war with no end in sight.\n\nbefore the hamas attacks on israel on oct. 7, water entered gaza through three pipelines from israel, and from desalination plants that rendered water from the sea and an aquifer drinkable. but the extreme siege israel imposed in the aftermath of the attacks has hampered that access.\n\non oct. 15, some water from israel began to flow again to the pipeline leading to southern gaza, according to the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. but on monday, the pipeline stopped working suddenly “for unknown reasons,” the office said.\n\na spokesman for cogat, the israeli authority for the palestinian territories, said in a statement on tuesday that israel had “no obligation to provide goods and services to the terrorist organization hamas — especially in cases where the enemy uses them for war purposes (for example, with respect to electricity and fuel).”\n\nwithout providing evidence, the spokesman said that hamas had hit a water pipeline with a rocket, “as well as nine out of 10 power lines that entered the gaza strip from israel.”\n\n“it should be emphasized that there is currently no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip,” the statement said, contradicting accounts, photos and videos from inside gaza documenting dire shortages and reports by aid organizations.\n\nthe u.n. humanitarian office said that limited amounts of fuel from u.n. reserves inside the territory had been distributed to key water facilities in southern and central gaza in recent days, allowing some of them to resume operations. two seawater desalination plants were working at about 40 percent capacity, it said, and some wells and pumping stations were also back online, allowing households still connected to the network to get water for a few hours a day.\n\nbut the north, where israel has focused a relentless campaign of airstrikes, was largely without any water at all. neither the desalination plant nor an israeli pipeline there was functioning, the u.n. humanitarian office said, while trucks that had been delivering water had to stop doing so on monday because of “ongoing military operations.”\n\nabu bakr bashir contributed reporting.\nkaroun demirjian\noct. 31, 2023, 3:58 p.m. etoct. 31, 2023\noct. 31, 2023, 3:58 p.m.

times\njacob j. lew sitting in front of a microphone. he is wearing a dark suit, a white shirt and a striped tie.\n\nthe senate on tuesday confirmed jacob j. lew as the next u.s. ambassador to israel, filling a post that the biden administration has argued is critical to efforts to help the country as it seeks to topple hamas in the gaza strip and ward off additional challenges from other iran-linked groups in the region.\n\nthe 53-to-43 vote reflected a deep partisan divide over whether mr. lew, who served as treasury secretary during the obama administration, was the right man for the job. only two republicans, senators lindsey graham of south carolina and rand paul of kentucky, joined all democrats in backing mr. lew’s confirmation.\n\nmr. lew’s confirmation comes as congress is rushing to respond to hamas’s oct. 7 attacks on israel and the ensuing war in gaza with a comprehensive package of emergency military and humanitarian assistance. president biden has requested a $105 billion national security spending package for the war efforts in israel and ukraine, as well as threats in the indo-pacific and along the u.s.-mexico border.\n\nthe task has been complicated by partisan divisions between the democratic-led senate, which is working to fulfill mr. biden’s request, and the republican-led house. the new speaker, mike johnson, republican of louisiana, has chosen instead to put forward a security assistance bill for israel alone and package it with a provision to roll back an i.r.s. enforcement initiative that was part of mr. biden’s deficit reduction measure.\n\nthough mr. biden nominated mr. lew before the war broke out, the urgency surrounding his confirmation has increased as the hostilities between israel and gaza have escalated. but while republicans acknowledged the need to install a senate-confirmed ambassador to the post, they rallied against mr. lew’s candidacy, arguing that his work promoting and carrying out a multinational nuclear pact with iran during the obama years had rendered him an untrustworthy interlocutor with israel.\n\nrepublicans and israeli officials vehemently opposed the iran deal, which eased certain sanctions in exchange for tehran giving up its nuclear ambitions, when it was struck in 2015. president donald j. trump later withdrew the united states from the pact.\n\n“a vote for him is a vote to subvert, not strengthen, our ally in its time of need,” senator tom cotton, republican of arkansas, said of mr. lew on the senate floor.\n\n“he lacks either the nerve or the will to really stand up for israel when it really matters and the chips are down, as they are today,” mr. cotton added.\n\ndemocrats have consistently defended mr. lew, insisting that his conduct as treasury secretary was above reproach and that his support for israel is undeniable.\n\n“mr. lew has a strong, long, proven record as a strong public servant and ferocious ally of israel,” senator chuck schumer, the majority leader, said on the floor on tuesday. he also asserted that “the need to confirm mr. lew is plain and irrefutable: israel is in crisis, america needs to stand with her, and a most urgent and obvious step would be to ensure that we have an ambassador in place.”\n\nrepublicans argued that mr. lew acted beyond his authority to try to ingratiate iran into the international banking system by leaning on banks to do business with tehran. they also accused him of trying to funnel money into iran’s coffers and of working to undermine israel’s interests at the united nations.\n\n“the underlying problem here is our policy and policies toward iran,” said senator jim risch of idaho, the top republican on the foreign relations committee. he argued that given iran’s key role as a financier of hamas and other groups in the region challenging israel, “the last thing we need is somebody who is very contrary to our view on how iran should be handled.”\n\ndemocrats said the israelis themselves backed mr. lew.\n\n“they are very much looking forward to having a confirmed ambassador from the united states in jerusalem to help in regards to the challenges they’re now facing as a result of hamas’s terrorist attack in israel, and they’re very much looking forward to jack lew being that ambassador — they told us that directly,” said senator benjamin l. cardin, democrat of maryland and the chairman of the foreign relations panel.\n\nhe added that mr. lew’s experience working on prisoner releases could prove critical as the united states seeks to free american and israeli hostages being held by hamas.\noct. 31, 2023, 3:42 p.m. etoct. 31, 2023\noct. 31, 2023, 3:42 p.m. et\n\nvivian yee and hiba yazbek\n\negyptian state media reported that some wounded

aimed at hamas militants hit a densely populated neighborhood in gaza, flattening buildings, leaving a massive crater and causing widespread damage. hamas health officials and the medical director of a nearby hospital said many people were wounded or killed.\n\n“the hospital’s yards, corridors and parks have been filled to the brim,” said atef al-kahlout, the director of the indonesian hospital in gaza, near the site of the strike. he added that the strike had “razed a residential square.” dr. marwan sultan, medical director of the indonesian hospital, said the facility was receiving hundreds of injured people and that dozens more were dead.\n\nisrael’s military said in a statement that its fighter jets carried out a broad attack that had struck hamas militants, including a commander, ibrahim biari, who israeli officials accused of having helped to plan the oct. 7 massacres that left 1,400 people dead, mostly civilians.\n\n“his elimination was carried out as part of a wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to the central jabaliya battalion, which had taken control over civilian buildings in gaza city,” the military said.\n\njabaliya\n\njabaliya\n\nrefugee camp\n\nlocation\n\nof damage\n\narea\n\nof detail\n\ngaza\n\ncity\n\ngaza\n\nsource: planet labs (satellite imagery, taken oct. 30); verified photos and

statement read on israeli television, daniel hagari, the chief israeli military spokesman, said the devastation in jabaliya was caused by the collapse of underground structures built by militants.\n\nthe strike on the site where mr. biari was located “collapsed other structures because there was extensive underground infrastructure in jabaliya whose goal was realizing terrorist operations,” he said. it was not immediately possible to verify the claim.\n\nphotographs showed shattered apartment blocks and piles of rubble around at least one large crater in jabaliya, as well as rows of what appeared to be bodies wrapped in white sheets on the ground.\n\nin one picture, scores of people stood around a crater, which was several yards deep and contained large shards of concrete. in another, civilians carried casualties away from damaged buildings.\n\nthe refugee camp in jabaliya is the largest of the gaza strip’s eight camps and is populated by people who were displaced from what is now israel in the 1940s and their descendants. while it is called a camp, the area is built up and densely populated, rather than a tent city. the camp is just to the north of gaza city, the largest urban settlement in gaza.\n\nthe united nations says that as of this year, there were more than 116,000 people registered at the camp with unrwa, the u.n. agency that aids palestinians, though it was unclear how many had left in recent weeks.\n\nisrael has continuously bombed gaza in retaliation for the oct. 7 attack. more than 8,500 people have been killed, including more than 3,500 children, according to the gazan health ministry, which is controlled by hamas. those numbers could not be independently confirmed.\n\nisraeli ground forces this week have been advancing toward gaza city from both the north and the east amid an even more intense barrage of airstrikes.\n\nisrael’s military has repeatedly warned civilians to evacuate to southern gaza. it has also conducted bombings in the south. the israeli government says that hamas’s military wing hides amid civilians and israel can legitimately target those areas. some human rights groups say that israel has used disproportionate force in its war against hamas and that some of its airstrikes amount to war crimes, something israel denies.\n\njordan’s foreign ministry condemned the attack on tuesday evening, writing that it held israel responsible for an “act that contradicts all human and moral values and the rules of international humanitarian law.” the foreign ministry of egypt called the attack “inhumane” and a “blatant violation by israeli forces of international law.”\n\nhiba yazbek contributed reporting.\naaron boxerman\noct. 31, 2023, 2:56 p.m. etoct. 31, 2023\noct. 31, 2023,

the hamas attacks.\n\nhumanitarian officials have warned that palestinian civilians face a growing catastrophe. “the scale of the horror people are experiencing in gaza is really hard to convey,”

a 19-year-old woman.\n\nthe israeli military provided few details about the operation along the gaza border to free the woman, pvt. ori megidish, whose release was kept quiet until word started to trickle out that she had been freed in an overnight raid two days prior.\n\nthe soldier came home to a country still deeply traumatized by the hamas attack on israel on oct. 7, while worried family members wondered how many of the other 240 hostages would make it home.\n\nthe predicament of the hostages underscores the extraordinary dilemma facing israel as it seeks to achieve its military goal of destroying hamas while attempting to free the men, women and children held in locations likely scattered around gaza.\n\nyoav gallant, israel’s defense minister, met with families of the hostages, and insisted those two goals were not incompatible.\n\n“if there is no military pressure on hamas, nothing will progress,” he told the families on sunday. “the military operation is intended, among other things, to increase the chance of returning our people.”\n\nhamas also appears to understand the nightmare facing israel, putting pressure on the israeli government to make concessions, including a break in the fighting. on tuesday, after the media reported that ms. megidish had been freed, hamas released a video of three israeli female hostages. one of the women, daniel aloni, 44,

images\na man, backlit by the sun, waves two flags over his head from the top of a truck.\n\non the far side of the sinai peninsula, about a six-hour drive from cairo through a largely empty egyptian desert, the rafah crossing is a dun-colored expanse of sand, concrete and not much else. isolated from the rest of the egypt by not only distance but also heavy military restriction, rafah can feel as distant from world events as any place on the planet.\n\nyet over the last three weeks of israel’s war with hamas in gaza, rafah has become the focus of heated negotiations, a place where many people, both powerful and powerless, have pinned their waning hopes. with israel imposing a suffocating siege on the densely populated enclave, rafah has become the only entry into the strip for aid to get to its population of 2.3 million people. so far, nothing and no one has been able to come out of gaza.\n\nbut that may soon change: egypt told the gazan authorities that it would take in 81 seriously wounded people from gaza and treat them in egyptian hospitals on wednesday, according to a statement from gaza’s general authority for crossings and borders.\n\negypt’s control of the rafah crossing has given it prominent status as one of gaza’s main benefactors and an important player in the conflict, a position that analysts say could help it unlock more international financial support amid a crushing economic crisis in the north african nation. egypt highlighted that role on tuesday, when the government took reporters on a tightly controlled trip to rafah.\n\naid trucks and army tanks lined the dusty road leading to the crossing. dozens of volunteers from government-sponsored aid groups and the egyptian red crescent milled about. several ambulances sat just inside the huge archway framing the crossing.\n\n“from the very first minute, we’ve been sending convoys of assistance from our organizations, and volunteers have been staying here around the clock for days,” prime minister mostafa madbouly said in a short news conference, as crowds of volunteers carrying egyptian flags and pro-palestinian signs gathered to listen. “egypt has shouldered the burden of the palestinian issue for years.”\n\nyet, partly because of factors beyond egypt’s control, rafah can meet only a fraction of gaza’s needs. just 241 trucks of aid have reached gaza since its gates opened two weeks ago after negotiations between the united states, israel, egypt and the u.n., a paltry number given the scale of the humanitarian need, aid officials say.\n\nisrael, which is carrying out stringent inspections of aid trucks, had been the main player slowing the process, according to the u.n., the european union, and egyptian and u.s. officials. but israel has now agreed to allow in about 80 trucks per day, according to two western diplomats briefed on the negotiations, still short of the 100 per day the u.n. says are needed.\n\non tuesday, 83 trucks arrived in gaza, said wael abu omar, a spokesman for the gaza side of the rafah crossing.\n\ndavid m. satterfield, the u.s. special envoy assigned to shepherd humanitarian issues in the conflict, said in cairo on sunday that aid needed to flow far more quickly in order to show increasingly distressed gazans that they did not need to resort to looting u.n. warehouses for sustenance, as happened several days ago.\n\n“this is a society on edge and desperate,” he said, adding that agencies distributing assistance “must be able to demonstrate that aid is not episodic.”\n\nnegotiators have also been pressing to evacuate people in gaza who hold foreign passports and their families, along with staff of foreign embassies and international organizations. over the past three weeks, people have rushed to the gaza side of the gate multiple times after being told they could cross, only to find it shut. the united states has publicly blamed hamas, the political and military organization that controls the enclave, while egypt has publicly blamed israel, saying it has made the crossing unsafe by repeatedly bombing the gaza side.\n\nbut nobody is publicly blaming egypt, though western diplomats involved in the evacuation effort say that egypt’s fears — including that a throng of desperate people could try to break through to egypt as soon as the gate opens — are also playing a role in foreign nationals’ continued inability to evacuate.\n\nthere is still a chance that an agreement could come together for people with foreign passports to leave. but egypt has made clear that it would not accept large numbers of palestinian refugees on its soil, a proposal that some in the international community, including israel, have reportedly floated. mr. madbouly categorically rejected such an idea, as did volunteers at the gate.\n\n“no, no, no, it’s not a solution, and i refuse this solution,” said mustafa mouftah, 30, a university lecturer from the nearby egyptian city of el arish who started volunteering as a translator at rafah a week ago. “this is our land, and we love this land.”\n\nmr. satterfield said on sunday that the united states also did not consider it to be an option, saying that the biden administration respected egypt’s sovereignty and that it believed that “the future of the palestinian people of gaza is in gaza.”\n\nhiba yazbek and iyad abuheweila contributed reporting.\nangelo

stuck in gaza.\n\nwhat was said\n\n“the white house admitted hamas is holding nearly 500 americans hostage in gaza.”\n— senator marsha blackburn in an oct. 31 post on x\nthis is misleading.\n\nwhite house officials said on tuesday that fewer than 10 americans were among the more than 200 people who had been kidnapped during the brutal assault by hamas on israel this month that left more than 1,400 dead.\n\nms. blackburn, a republican senator representing tennessee, appeared to be referring to estimates of the number of americans who have been unable to leave gaza since the war broke out, about 500 to 600 citizens. but that information is not new and was not part of a white house admission, as ms. blackburn’s post on x, the platform formerly known as twitter, said. officials have relayed that estimate for weeks.\n\nresponses to and shares of the claim show many interpreted the senator’s post as a new development. some right-wing personalities on social media accused the white house of “covering up” the information for weeks.\n\nafter publication, ms. blackburn’s office said the senator believed the americans unable to leave gaza were hostages under federal law.\n\nthe exact reason for the impasse preventing foreign citizens from leaving is not entirely clear. but in a cnn interview on sunday, jake sullivan, president biden’s national security adviser, did indeed blame hamas, as u.s. officials have done before.\n\n“it is true the egyptians are prepared to allow american citizens and foreign nationals to come through the rafah gate into egypt,” mr. sullivan said, referring to the only access point not controlled by israel where civilians can enter and leave gaza by land. “the israelis have no issue with that. hamas has been preventing their departure and making a series of demands. i can’t go through those demands in public, but that is the subject of the discussions and the negotiations that are ongoing.”\n\nsecretary of state antony j. blinken similarly faulted hamas during testimony before a senate committee on tuesday, though he offered slightly different figures on the number of americans in gaza.\n\n“we have about 400 american citizens and their family members — so it’s roughly 1,000 people — who are stuck in gaza and want to get out,” he said, adding: “the impediment is simple. it’s hamas. we’ve not yet found a way to get them out by whatever, through whatever place and by whatever means that hamas is not blocking, but we’re working that with intermediaries.”\noct. 31, 2023, 7:58 p.m. etoct. 31, 2023\noct. 31, 2023, 7:58 p.m.

25\n\nthe hamas attack on israel on oct. 7 killed more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers, according to count by the israeli prime minister’s office. israel’s response — a bombing campaign and now a major ground assault — had killed 8,309 as of sunday, according to a count by the gaza health ministry, which is controlled by hamas, a militant group designated a terrorist organization by the u.s. state department.\n\nin any war, statistics on deaths are fuzzy and subject to change. almost a month after the hamas attack, the precise number of dead from it is unclear, as 200 bodies remain unidentified. as of tuesday, israel’s haaretz newspaper had published the names of 1,009 verified dead (657 civilians and the rest soldiers, police and rescue services), with names being added daily.\n\nthe daily death count released by the gaza health ministry has helped stir protests around the world, as the total has quickly exceeded the number of dead suffered by israel. the israel defense forces said it launched more than 7,000 airstrikes into the gaza strip, a seaside area that’s only twice the size of d.c. with more than 2 million people.\n\nat an oct. 25 white house news conference, a reporter began a question to biden by noting that “the hamas-controlled gaza health ministry says israeli forces have killed over 6,000 palestinians, including 2,700 children.”\n\nbiden’s dismissal of the ministry’s statistics — that he had “no confidence” in them — was striking. the state department has regularly cited ministry statistics without caveats in its annual human rights reports. the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha), which tracks deaths in the conflict, has found the ministry’s numbers to be reliable after conducting its own investigation. “past experience indicated that tolls were reported with high accuracy,” an ocha official told the fact checker.\n\nmedhat abbas, the gaza health ministry’s director general, said in an interview that he was so disturbed by biden’s comment that he ordered his staff to release a 212-page document with the name of every victim identified so far — including age, sex and identity number. the list included almost 7,000 names.\n\nwith any numbers, there are caveats. questions have also been raised about the ministry’s statistics after a still-murky incident at the al-ahli hospital was said to have killed nearly 500 people. so let’s explore whether biden’s opinion of the statistics has a factual basis.\nhow the hamas health ministry collects data\n\nabbas said the ministry primarily relies on death certificates from hospitals and morgues in compiling its daily counts of the number of dead in the conflict, which is then collected in a computerized system. in the document released after biden’s comment, which was through oct. 25, the deadliest day was oct. 24, when 756 people were reported killed, followed by oct. 23, when 704 were reported killed, and oct. 17, when 678 were reported killed. the hospital incident took place oct. 17.\n\nand for each day, more children than adults were listed as killed. on virtually all days — with the notable exception of oct. 17, the day of the hospital incident — more males than females were reported as killed.\n\nin its death counts, the ministry makes no distinction between the deaths of civilians and combatants. neither does it list whether a person was killed because a palestinian rocket aimed at israel fell short of its target and crashed into a populated area of gaza. the ministry only lists aggregate totals.\n\nocha, when it does its own post-conflict reports, seeks to determine the percentage of combatants. after a 2012 clash, for instance, ocha determined there were 2,133 deaths in gaza, of which 644, or 30 percent, were combatants.\n\nin 2014, the new york times analyzed 1,431 names listed by the ministry as being killed in a war with israel that year. the newspaper found that the population most likely to be militants, men ages 20 to 29, was the most overrepresented in the death toll. that population represented 9 percent of gaza’s residents but 34 percent of those killed.\n\nthe meir amit intelligence and terrorism information center, an israeli organization, released a detailed report on the first 152 names on the 2014 list and said it concluded that 47 percent were militants. yossi kuperwasser, a retired brigadier general affiliated with the center, said the center has no plans to analyze the names released in the current conflict, due to a lack of resources.\n\nwhatever the percentage of combatants, there was little disagreement about the number of palestinians killed in the 2014 war. the gaza health ministry said 2,310, ocha said 2,251, and israel’s foreign ministry said 2,125.\nhow the hospital-blast deaths were reported\n\naround 7 p.m. local time on oct. 17, an explosion occurred at al-ahli hospital. about an hour and a half later, the gaza health ministry reported on its facebook page that israel had targeted the hospital. the source of the explosion remains unclear. a washington post visual investigation found that the damage was not consistent with an airstrike and probably not consistent with an artillery shell, but reporters could not conclusively determine the cause. israel has denied responsibility and blamed an errant palestinian rocket.\n\nan hour later, the ministry said most of the dead were women and children. subsequent posts referred to a “massacre,” but it was not until the next day, about 23 hours after the explosion, that the ministry posted an official count of 471 dead.\n\nbut almost immediately after the attack — about two hours — news organizations began to report that a ministry spokesman had said 500 people were killed. the speed of the estimate called into question its accuracy.\n\nyet the very first reports in arabic that were attributed to a health ministry spokesman referred to 500 “victims,” using an arabic word suggesting casualties, which could include those injured. confusingly, another post referred to “500 victims falling,” which could mean dead. at almost the same time, al jazeera quoted a gaza civil defense spokesman as saying 300 people were killed, also suggesting the death toll was not as high as 500.\n\nbut at about the same time, an unnamed ministry spokesman was quoted by both al jazeera and reuters in english as saying 500 people were killed. the palestinian ministry of foreign affairs, based in ramallah in the west bank and not associated with hamas, appeared to make it official with its own post: “israeli warplanes bombed al-ahli arab hospital (baptist hospital) in the center of gaza city, resulting in the martyrdom of 500 palestinians, including children and women.”\n\nthe news reports sparked demonstrations across the arab world and other countries. but when dawn broke and clear images of the explosion site were visible, the damage appeared less extensive than imagined. u.s. intelligence sources claimed that the death toll was “probably at the low end of the 100-to-300 spectrum.”\n\nabbas, the ministry director, said he saw many estimates the night of oct. 17, including one that said 800 dead and another one claiming as many as 1,300 dead. “at the end of the day, the death certificates totaled 471,” he said — a number that happened to closely track the initial reports.\n\nomar shakir, the israel and palestine director at human rights watch, said that in his experience, the ministry’s numbers are “generally reliable.” but he made a distinction between estimates given in the heat of the moment and the official count that the ministry releases at the end of the day. “the statements must be distinguished from the aggregate death toll,” he said.\n\nan israeli strike tuesday on gaza’s jabalya refugee camp killed or wounded 400, the ministry said, a more cautious statement than after the hospital incident.\n\nthe white house did not provide an on-the-record comment. when asked about biden’s comment, state department spokesman matthew miller last week said, “we don’t have any way to make an accurate assessment of our own about the number of civilians who have died in gaza. there is not an independent body that’s operating in gaza that can provide an accurate number. but we do have skepticism about everything that hamas says.”\nthe bottom line\n\nthe president appeared to show excessive skepticism when he commented that he had “no confidence” in the health ministry’s figures and that he “had no notion that the palestinians are telling the truth” about the death toll. the gaza health ministry has had a pretty good track record with its death estimates over the years, notwithstanding that it is part of the hamas-run government, and biden is in a position to know that.\n\nthe initial reports on the hospital strike attributed to the ministry do give pause, however. two hours is too soon to count 500 casualties, even if not all are dead — and one could be skeptical about the fact that the final count came so close to the initial estimate. but biden was not asked about the hospital strike; he was asked about the aggregate number, which then stood at 6,000. a week later, the reported figure had risen by 2,000. with the numbers so large, whether a particular incident killed 300 people or 500 people seems less relevant.\n\nthe president could have noted that, based on previous israel-hamas wars, about one-third of deaths were likely to be combatants. but he swept away all the numbers as not credible. that’s his opinion — but it’s remarkably uninformed by history and precedent.",11/1/2023,News,1,0,0
